### Case Study

> In 2016, doctors at the [MassGeneral Hospital for Children](https://www.massgeneral.org/children/)  were challenged with the decision of carrying out surgery on the pair of conjoined twins. The twins were joined from the thorax to the pelvis, shared a liver and bladder, and had three legs.

> Following medical examination, doctors determined that only one of the girls would survive surgery. Furthermore, as the hospital's chairman on pediatrics articulated to the parents of the twins, if the surgery was not done, both twins would die.

> Note, the surgery would require a team of over 100 doctors.

*As Chairman of the Hospital's committee on pediatric ethics, what decision would you make under such circumstances? Also consider the ethical dilemmas that both the doctors and parents of the twins face. Could you think of a situation in which there is low ethical congruence?*
